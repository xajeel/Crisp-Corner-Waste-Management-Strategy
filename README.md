### Task: 
Conduct a comprehensive analysis of Crisp Corner's past 3 to 4 years of data related to raw material usage, wastage, associated costs, and reasons contributing to wastage.

### End Goal:
The primary aim of this project is to provide actionable insights and recommendations to Mr. Arslan, the owner of Crisp Corner.

## Insights
- Restaurant waste nearly 3.3% of raw materials each year
